## What I've done

-   Dataset
    1. Collected A dataset from Kaggle.com
    2. Added more data in the dataset.
    3. Added my own data to the dataset.

-   Model   
    1. Executed CNN model to identify leaf condition.
    2. Executed the same dataset to SVM model for      classification.
    3. Executed the same dataset to ANN model.

- Outcome   
    1. CNN model 99.72%.
    2. ANN model 95.62%.
    3. SVM model 94%.

-   Verdict     
    CNN was the comprehensive winner.
